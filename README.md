# 📊 Data Science Job Salaries (2020–2024)

This project explores **Data Science job salaries between 2020 and 2024**, analyzing trends, patterns, and key factors affecting compensation. The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and analyzed using Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

The project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, preprocessing, and visualization techniques to derive insights from salary data across different roles, experience levels, and work setups.

## 🔍 Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Univariate & Multivariate Analysis
* Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Salary comparison across roles and years (2020–2024)
* Insights on job titles like *Data Scientist, ML Engineer, Data Analyst, BI Analyst, etc.*
